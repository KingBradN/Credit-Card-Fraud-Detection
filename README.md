Unsupervised Learning
CSV data set is bigger than 25MB.... It is however downloadable on Kaggle. 

Results:

Two methods/Algorithms used, Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest.

Isolation forest gave us a better result, at about 30% accuracy, precission and f1-score. A better result could result on using all of the data as we used only 10%.
